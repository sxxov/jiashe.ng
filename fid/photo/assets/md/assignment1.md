### They Drive at Night

[(collection) by Henri Prestes](https://www.behance.net/gallery/71620633/They-Drive-by-Night)

/{ hs-centre  vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/others/From%20collection=They%20Drive%20by%20Night%20-%20Henri%20Prestes.jpg)

/

* Chosen for its unique atmosphere

* Fog limits what the viewer can see, which makes it feel very mystical

* The viewer is able to put themselves into the picture as the atmosphere is very effectively captured through the washed out colours

* The headlights, having two points coming from afar puts the viewer at a state of unease, as through pareidolia, they can be perceived as eyes

* The greenery and lack of human structures shows a rural area and is able to make the viewer feel as though they were stranded, adding on to the general eerie atmosphere

### I've lost it all, I'm just a silhoutte

/

* Chosen for its special way of presenting light & colour
* Inverts the elements that catch the eye; background takes precedence
* The subject, being backlit and framed as a silhouette accentuates the shape and edges, keeping just enough information for the imagination to piece together a story
* The bokeh in the background acts as a frame and a drive towards the subject as well, being in the two corners
* The overall atmosphere gives off a sense of the fear of the unknown in the future, as the world celebrates the milestone

### 商店街、看板、路地。

/

* Chosen for its shaded, cloudy & cold feel
* Colours portray a feel of gloominess, with soft shadows presenting an uneasy sense of peace
* Shows off imperfections in the objects we see and experience in our everyday lives*
* The red shades of the Japanese bricks also brings a different take to street photography
* With the text being bold and upfront, the subject becomes the art of typography, and how it has been put into use

### Glimmers

[by John Francis Peters](https://jfpetersphoto.tumblr.com/post/174570440701/waiting-for-the-rain-hanoi-vietnam-2018)



/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

/

* Chosen for its sharp yet dreamy showcase of light and reflections
* It captures the curiosity of the child, looking at the sky, as if they want to chase the stars
* The reflections of the shared raincoat frames the parent and the child as a collective
* The child’s arms on their side and their focus not on the road, portrays the carelessness of a mind not influenced by the world
* The complexity of the background is also cancelled out by bokeh, as if the viewer is taking a trip in the child’s thoughts

### Baker Lake Trail

/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/others/Baker%20Lake%20Trail%20-%20burningmine.jpg)



/

- Chosen for its magical portrayal of the unknown
- There’s a sense of peace and safety, even though the viewer is surrounded by trees that block light & vision
- Captures crushed dark spots; bright light spots, with everything else still clear, making it look like a very bright cloudy day
- The fog naturally shifts our focus to the trees in the foreground, along with the path that points into the middle
- A path that leads to somewhere that the viewer can’t see, presents itself as a “no going back” road to something more

### genting

(collection) by me xd



/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/me/IMG_0071.jpg)



/

* The photo was taken at night next to a sharp light source, which caused the stark contrast and defined shadows

* The rocks are of a “foot massage” track at a recreational area of a condo on genting

* The shadows and textures of the photo resemble the surface of the moon, bringing along the unease that would be portrayed through it

* The composition draws the viewer’s eyes onto the crack through the middle of the photo, and then brought around the nooks and crannies of the photo subsequently by the line of the crack

### I gently open the door

/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/me/IMG_9618.jpg)



/

* The photo is taken during a cloudy day with fog in the air as well, giving it a diffused “ambient occlusion” type of look

* The composition drives the viewer’s eyes to snap to the flower as there’s a discrepancy between it and the colours around it

* With the flower literally hanging off one thread of a spider web, it depicts the elegant fragility and stability of nature
* The fact that the flower is hung above a drain also shows us that nature will always have the decision of which legacies and memories get preserved

### some of us

/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/me/IMG_9746.jpg)



/

* The photo was taken on a bright, yet foggy day which grants it a flat look

* All the beams in the structure pulls the viewer’s eyes into the centre, at which they start their exploration

* With the hint of the butterfly at the top, this picture was taken in a butterfly farm, with nets on the ceilings

* The geometrical lines, grungy textures, and relatively monochromatic colours portray an industrial aesthetic

* Even with the industrial look, the wide angle at which the photo was taken at, grants the viewer a sense of freedom, even while being with trapped butterflies

### unnatural

/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/me/insta2.jpg)



/

* The photo was taken during a foggy mid-day on a slanted road

* The wild dog being the centre of attention, acts as a separator of the two halves of the photo

* The dog’s tired expression and old age almost parodies the subjects of normal street photography, which often stars old and tired people minding their own lives

* The relatively empty and open space around the subject lets it speak for itself

* The greenery in the background acts as a restriction and also directs the viewer back to the main subject

### weekends

(collection) by me xd



/{ hs-centre vs-centre }

![](/fid/photo/assets/img/assignment1/me/insta1.png)



/

* The photo was taken on a sunny street with very vibrant and animated colours

* The street and lines all point towards the subjects which are carelessly looking around and enjoying the time

* The subjects don’t fit in with the age and wear of their surroundings, almost like they’re from the future

* The bright, saturated, & warm nature of the photo gives off a very happy and eager tone; the cool, geometric, & subdued parts of the photo keeps the photo balanced and keeps the viewer on their toes and wanting to know more

## reflection:

_



!/

​	Through this assignment, I have found myself a new view on the photographs taken by others and myself. I came into the work thinking that it was just about translating the story the photographer was trying to express through their work; I came out realising that there's always more to how the picture is composed, shot, colour graded, etc. 

​	By actually jotting down all the things that were implicitly shown, it gave me a new goal to shoot for, when shooting. Not to tell a story, but to leave just enough for the viewer to construct their own.

​	Even with that said, through some meticulous digging, I have managed to expose myself to more of the theoretical nitty gritty things that are embedded into every picture. Seeing how each picture is differently built and glued together, with a lot more nuonce than what is seen on the surface, is definitely an eye opener. That and how even the smallest change in the types of building blocks and gluing substance used, can cause astronomical differences in the final product.

​	Have I completed the objective "To discern and reflect on what makes a good image theoretically"? I would think so myself. I've learnt that a good image will consist of properly set up technical aspects (correct exposure, meaningful composition, focused subject, etc), while also expressing the views of the photographer. How will I apply these learnings on my own photography process? I will make sure I take the time to plan out the shot when time is available; have the finger on the trigger to prepare for any split moments or natural opportunities to be caught.

​	To conclude, this assignment might just push me to capture more slices of the world for myself, through photography.
