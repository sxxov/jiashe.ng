/

This photo was taken beside of a lamp, creating a spot-light effect which brings along with it interesting shadows and contrasts. Behind him was also a computer monitor with notepad open on full screen to act as a subtle backlight. The empty background also gives full attention to the subject.

/

This photo was taken with the lamp relatively, directly pointing onto the subject. The extra light and the tighter zoom gives the viewer another perspective on how different people process sadness. Some want to be attended to; some want to be left.

## anger:

/

This photo was taken with softer lighting, and even tighter framing. The “all fill light” look gives the photo a look that makes it feel like realty. This really showcases the emotion felt by the subject. The white shirt which matches with the background gives complete attention to the subject too.

This photo was taken up close with deep contrasts. It basically only shows the viewer the face. The subject’s stern and viscous stare catches the viewer’s eyes, enabling the emotion of the moment to be captured and expressed.

/

This photo was taken a little further back, from the distance of a first impression. This gives the viewer some space to breathe and not be filled with the claustrophobia like in the anger collection. The photo is also straightened not with the surrounding, but with the eyes, which is what is first perceived.

/

This photo was taken with a flash shining on top of the subject. The subtle smile and the carefree nature of the subject is definitely captured. The shallow depth of field also creates many bokeh balls in the foreground and background, leaving only the head sharp, directing the viewers there.

This photo was taken close up, showing the intricate details of the subject, along with the scratches and imperfections. The bottle at the side gives the photo many weird and fancy refractions that liven up the atmosphere and give it plenty of cool shadows, contrasts, and textures.

/

This photo was taken under morning sun, giving it sharp shadows. These shadows give the photo splotches of light and dark, giving life to a relatively geometric subject. The subject also has very interesting textures and depths going on, adding detail to where the eye will flow to.

/

This photo was taken with a plastic enclosure framing the subjects on top of a lamp. The subjects originally had different colours but after it was turned monochrome, how the different shades of the colours interacted with each other became the main focal point.

/

This photo was taken straight under the sun. The refractions that come from the transparent part of the subject creates a very interesting and abnormal looking image in black & white. The textures of the plane under the subject also gives the photo with a relatively clean looking subject, some grunge.

## reflection:

/{ long }

​	This series required me purely to focus on the luminance of the photos that were taken. Stripping away colour is like if you removed a dimension from the product, think like going from 3D to 2D. With the confines set, I set out to capture 6 photos showcasing emotions in the living souls, and 4 photos showcasing products around me.

​	I decided in this series, I would go with a 1:1 aspect ratio for the photos. This aspect ratio is the best in my opinion for a no frills and focused look. This is because a square will not allow any extra space vertically or horizontally for more of the contextual background information. This almost always pulls focus into the centre and encourage a centre composition style.

​	I own a zoom lens, which gives me opportunities to play around with the focal length and portray different atmospheres through the photos. I decided to try to get as up close and personal as one can be for photos that would benefit from it, while not giving away too much of the surrounding in the others to keep it in line with the focused and expressive direction of this series.

​	After going through and actually taking all the photos, it has really given me a new sense of appreciation for black and white photography. Black and white photography is normally looked at as either something from the past, or an effect that’s applied to hide flaws in colour of a photo. Through this assignment, I’ve learnt that to compose a truly good black and white photograph, you have to start off having only the luma channel in mind. This is because without colours, many things tend to blend together into a same shade of grey. It is then where contrast and shape is required to construct the separation that would've been colour's job.

​	Even though contrast and shape exist in every photo, they don't usually exist in a vacuum, contradictory to black & white photos. This might sound like a handicap at first, but it can be a super power. Just like any other super power though, to channel it is a skill. I think I have definitely gotten more than a few key titbits to improve my black & white game.

​	To conclude, this assignment might just push me to take more black & white photos and pay more attention to the luminance of the other photos I take.
