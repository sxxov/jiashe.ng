# Assignment 1

##### Create a Gift for Someone You Can't Meet In Person

## Introduction:

/

​	This task was given based on the restrictions put in place by the Movement Control Order (MCO). It is an individual task, to create a gift to be given to someone that cannot be met in person. There is a lot of directions to be taken in constructing the gift, from soft toys to software, since no restrictions were given in what the gift could be. While it can be a definite up side, in practice there are many hurdles that have to be overcome in order to take advantage of the given freedom.

## Process:

##### Empathy

​	In light of this assignment being the first, there were pronounced stumbles in the process of working around the idea of "empathy". Even with that said, this part of the assignment went on relatively hitch-less after the main concepts were grasped. The result was a clearer view of what was to be expected moving forward.

_

/

##### Definition

​	This was the part where the target's interests were broken down into chunks and then further elaborated. This part was relatively painless as well, since we had a solid foundation coming into it.

_

##### Ideation

​	Going through this process, the concept of ideas as jewellery presented itself overtly. This was when the freedom of infinite choice became a double edged sword. It was a challenge separating good ideas from regular shower thoughts. The final ideas were ideas derived from what was explored in the definition stage and then subsequently cherry picked to narrow down to the most intriguing and memorable gifts. A "melon candy dispenser" was the idea that survived flowing down the funnel.

##### Prototyping

​	The idea was split into three parts and a few sub-parts:

/

* **Base**, which handled the funnelling, housing/supporting other parts, and contained some heft to keep the centre of gravity low.
  * **Internal spinning mechanism**, which was what portioned off the sweets
  * **Internal spinning mechanism axle**, which played a part to keep the mechanism from staying in place. 
  * **Handle**, which let the user spin the internal mechanism and let candy be dispensed.
* **Reservoir**, which acted as a container for the candy. This was painted and sculpted to look like a melon on the exterior, in line with the idea.
  * **Cap**, which was just a quick way to restrict access to the reservoir from the top.
* **Output catcher**, which caught the candy coming out of the dispenser.

/

​	The modelling of the melon candy dispenser was the first item in the agenda. This was done in Blender 2.8 with my very limited modelling skill and experience. A downloaded 3D model was used as reference to make sure some parts were 3D printable. The final model ended up with major topology changes and reworks in every model to make it more friendly to 3D print and render.

_

​	After the initial modelling and subsequent polish was added, they were put into Ultimaker Cura to be sliced into gcode, which was what a 3D printer reads. The slicing went on without any major hiccups, as a lot of thought was put into the final model (splitting reservoir to reduce supports, correcting incorrect topology to make sure faces were all manifold, etc). It is here where it was decided that 20% infill would be sufficient as there was not a lot of filament left to be used.

_

​	With the slicing out of the way, it was on to the actual printing. There were defects in the first few prints which had to be fixed up because of a miscalibrated print bed. Adding on to that, there were winds which blew along the print which caused lacklustre adhesion of the first layer. This initiated a domino effect when it would lift up midway during prints and cause the bases of final prints to become distorted and curved. With a lot of creative hot glue gun acrobatics, these errors were fixed after the print.

_

​	Now that the printing was finished, it was on to the finishing. Hot glue was used on the surface of the reservoir to give it texture and depth, with the hopes of creating a more appealing watermelon illusion. Primer, grass green spray paint, various green watercolours, and lacquer were added on top of the hot glue layer on the reservoir. A less extravagant approach was taken for the base and it was coated with a few layers of flat black spray paint, with other components left with their initial plastic as the surface. Less is more in this case, to reduce complications in food safety of the final product.



> Note: Care was taken to prevent paints from getting into parts where candy would touch. This is to reduce the risk of paint getting into parts where the food safe, lacquer is unable to cover.

_

​	Finally, chocolate became the candy of choice and the whole dispenser was assembled to become the final product.

##### Presentation

​	The final product was presented to Manfred, the chosen subject. This was done through a video call on the chatting app "Messenger". At first he was made known that the call was being recorded through screenshots. When first shown the final product, he expressed surprise and was ecstatic with what it looked like on first glance. As he was shown the logo part of the melon candy dispenser, he noted that it was "cool" and he "wanted it right now". 

_

​	Even with the good initial reception, there were a few hitches in presentation:

* Chocolate got stuck in the mechanism because of the size of the chocolate
* There were challenges opening the top cap as the final finish messed with some of the tolerances

_

​	A few "posters" were also created as advertisement to be presented. The typography was using a font face that was frequently used by him.

## Reflection:

/

​	I've learnt a few things going through the assignment. Notably, there's always a better solution than what is had, and one can use this design process to iterate upon the foundation. Other than that, I feel like I have increased in proficiency with the tools and programs used to complete this assignment, as well as a closer bond with my friend, Manfred.
