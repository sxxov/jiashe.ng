# Assignment 2

##### Raise Awareness for "Micro-Agriculture"

## introduction:

/

​	As topics to raise awareness come, "Micro-Agriculture" was definitely one that put up a challenging first impression. Another spanner thrown into the cogs was that this assignment would be done in groups. Group assignments get their bad name from sub-par members and unfair delegation; I had both worries in my mind when receiving the news. MCO still being in full effect, we also had a smaller scope that we could explore — awareness spreading only through social media. With all these criteria in place, me and my assigned group members started our engines and were off to the races.

## process:

##### Empathize

​	We had already hit our first hurdle here, micro-agriculture was a relatively obscure topic. Well established research on was hard to come by. Even with that though, all of us still managed to scrape and drill around the internet to collect enough information to establish a good starting point. We distilled down the core components of our given topic so it would be a lot simpler to break down, later in the process. A survey was also used to probe general interests & intents on planting in their own home.

##### Define

​	Here is where the few essential questions were thrown out — who, where, what, why. 4 of these items acted as pillars to guide and hold up what was about to come next. Our original demographic of "teenagers" became a problem as it placed too many bets on the future instead of what could be done now. This brought us to narrow down and ultimately settle on a subset of what we originally came up with — "New home owners". The people we are targeting would now be able to realistically take action immediately.

##### Ideate

​	"Where is the most practical place to reach most persons?", was the biggest question we tried to answer with this step. Between all the social media giants, we had to make an optimal choice (or multiple if it came to that). We focused on a lot of the technical aspects of each prospect — cost per click, click through rate, demographic, net daily users. While we worked, the idea of a custom "attack strategy", specially crafted for each social media, became something we wanted too. After all the research was said and done, Facebook came out with a surprisingly large lead, with it fulfilling and even exceeding most of our requirements.

##### Prototype

​	This was split into multiple parts and sub-parts. All of which enabled a more "oiled" process in achieving the final product.

/

* **Pre-game**, which encapsulates all the tasks that has to happen before the actual video production.
  * **Asset Collection**, which used a script to pull images from Google. Said images would be used in the video as the background.
  * **Data Collection**, which was a group effort to pull assorted information from corners of the internet as well as . Said data was put into headers & sub-headers.
  * **Dimensions Planning**, which was where we determined the best aspect ratio & resolution for the video.

/

* **Building Blocks**, which is the base components that will be seen everywhere.
  * **Font**, which we ended up with "Lemon Milk", as it was bold and modern, which suit the demographic.
  * **Background**, which became a warping overlay with images collected from earlier underneath.
  * **Pizzazz**, which we achieved with a "Roughen Edges" effect to create a more organic look.

/

* **Construction**, which is where everything we prepared was put together.
  * **Intro**, which is the main eye catcher that reels in the audience.
  * **Counter**, which is the separator for each section of the video.
  * **5-1 (Why)**, which answers the question of "why to plant X"
  * **0 (How)**, which tries to gives the viewer instructions on how to plant the no.1 plant at home.

/

​	Asset collection was the first item on the agenda. This was breezed through by using a script I wrote that would go through Google images and download the first 100 valid images of the plant required. It definitely required some debugging to get right, as the library I used, "puppeteer", required some caressing to have it work, but I think it was worth it. The time saved was able to be poured into tasks that would increase the quality of the final product. Along with that, data collection was performed as a group effort, with everyone contributing either raw data to be shrunk, or joke data to be used in sub-headings.

​	Figuring out what the building blocks would be was definitely an interesting ride, as it had to combine overall attractiveness with general clarity. This balance would also have to be considered with the dimensions minimized and blown up. Asking around allowed me to gather info to work on it.

​	The construction was done in Adobe After Effects and the background came first. I used a previously written script to scale it up to a proper size and stagger it along the items. Items in this case referring to numbers 5-0. With the overlay and a colour grade added, the background was finished. This brings us to the rest of the video. A contrast was needed between items, so the counter ended up with a dark background, and the items with a light background. This creates a clear organization of information. With all that and a few tidbits added on to it, the video was finished.

##### Present

​	Mock-ups were created to visualize how it would look like in production. The mock-ups along with the final video was sent out to a few friends of the members for outside opinion. They liked the video and replied with similar criticisms:

* **Distracting background**, resolved by giving minimized context to viewers.
* **Text duration is too low**, resolved by decreasing duration of text reveal animation.

## reflection:

_

/

​	I've learnt many things going through this assignment. Notably, a group project doesn't have to be hell. Delegation of tasks went on better than expected and everyone gave their absolute best to their own abilities. I've definitely also learned more about how to navigate through the design process with something that's very real-world. With the video itself, I've also learnt a lot about scripting and editing, as it was crucial in getting the final product out. In conclusion, the people, the skills, and the experiences, all landed my a great learning experience.
